## Technology Stack

We use [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno) to build our frontend for NobUS.
Uno Platform is a cross-platform framework
that lets us write C# and XAML code once and run it on multiple platforms.
It is also open-source and free to use.
Uno Platform renders widgets natively on each platform,
so our app looks and feels like a native app.
We can also create pixel-perfect UI with ease.

Sometimes we may need to write some platform-specific code to access native features
that are not supported by Uno Platform.
