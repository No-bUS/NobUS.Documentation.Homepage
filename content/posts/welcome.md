# Introducing NobUS

NobUS is a bus info app designed for the NUS community.
It strives to offer a modern and intuitive interface
to help you plan your bus trips on campus.

# How is NobUS different?

The official NUSNextBUS app has many limitations and drawbacks.
You can read some comments on official
[app]({{< ref "comments/on-official-nextbus-app.md" >}})
and [API]({{< ref "comments/on-official-nextbus-api.md" >}})
for further details.
NobUS aims to overcome these issues and provide a better user experience.
